"""Product Owner Loompa: owns the backlog and reviews what feeds it.

Fase 1 (ADR-0006): reviews the spec with the "No Invention" gate — every acceptance criterion
must trace back to something the founder said, the constitution or an existing spec. Fase 3
makes this agent the only writer of the backlog: the methods below are the only door to
`loompa.backlog.Backlog`, and Master, Kaizen, the dashboard and the founder's answers all
come through them.

You are the Product Owner Loompa. Review the specification written for the story below before
engineering starts. Apply the "No Invention" gate:
- Every acceptance criterion must trace to the founder's request, the founder's notes, the
  constitution or an existing spec. Anything else is invented scope and must be flagged.
- The spec must be complete enough to build from (goal, in/out of scope, testable criteria) and
  must not contradict the constitution.
Respond with JSON only:
{{"approved": bool, "unsupported": [str], "missing": [str], "notes": str}}
`unsupported` lists criteria that cannot be traced (quote them); `missing` lists what a builder
would still need. Approve when there is nothing unsupported and nothing critical missing.
Write in {language}.
